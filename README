A clumsy imitation of the DotCamera demo for SwissGL [1]. Mainly as an execuse for me to play with:

- Latest Bevy version
  + bevy-inspector-egui (https://github.com/jakobhellermann/bevy-inspector-egui/)
- Compute shader
  + rendering pipeline
  + WGSL
  + bevy_app_compute (https://github.com/Kjolnyr/bevy_app_compute)
- Rust's portable simd (https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/simd/struct.Simd.html)

This repo offers several feature toggles:

- cpu: all computation performed on cpu
- gpu: enable compute shaders
- simd: some image processing was done with simd
